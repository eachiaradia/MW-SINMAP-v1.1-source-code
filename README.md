MW-SINMAP-v1.1-source-code
==========================

The MW-SINMAP 1.1 project is an alternative version to original SINMAP v1.0 and v2.0 software published on the web site http://hydrology.usu.edu/sinmap2/ (Pack et al., 1998-2005).
The MW-SINMAP plug-in is developed with Visual Basic 2005 Express Edition.
The easiest way is to install the Microsoft IDE and then open the file "MWSinmap.vbproj". Youâ€˜ll probably need to refresh all the references in the project and in particular to the MapWinGIS, MapWindow and ZedGraph libraries.
The SINMAP executable file (sinmap.exe) is compiled with standard C compiler (GCC). You can open the project file "sinmapor.dev?" with the Bloodshed Dev C++ IDE.
Binaries are also provided here https://github.com/eachiaradia/MW-SINMAP-v1.1-source-code/blob/master/MW-SINMAP-v1.1-binaries.zip. Please refer to the user manual for installation tips.

```diff
- Please note that MW-SINMAP will work only with MapWindow 4.6.
You can find the MapWindow 4.6 installer here https://smartgreen.unimi.it/plugin/MapWindow46SR.exe [unofficial] or here https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=mapwindow4 [look in the entire archive]
